## üöÄ Overview

This repository provides **GitLab Docker images for ARM64 architecture**.

GitLab does not officially support ARM64 yet.
As a result, GitLab does not provide **Docker images for ARM64**.
While there are some repositories that attempt to address this issue, they often take time to release updates.
This poses a challenge, especially when a security patch requires an immediate update.

To solve this problem, I created this repository providing a GitHub Action that checks for new releases daily and
automatically builds a **Docker image** for the latest releases.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Updates**:  
  A GitHub Action checks the latest releases of the official GitLab Docker images and triggers the build process when
  a new version is available.  
  This ensures the repository always provides up-to-date images for ARM64.

- **Fully Automatic**:  
  No manual intervention is required. The entire process, from release checking to image building is automated.

- **Compatibility**:  
  These images are build for **ARM64 architecture**, making GitLab accessible to users on **ARM-based platforms**.  
  They are also compatible with **x86_64 architecture**. For more details,
  see [Multi-Architecture Support](#-multi-architecture-support)

## üìã Requirements

To use the Docker images built by this repository, you need:

- **ARM64 Architecture** (e.g. Raspberry Pi 4/5, ARM64 servers)
  or **x86_64 Architecture** (See [Multi-Architecture Support](#-multi-architecture-support))
- **Docker** installed on your system

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Pull the Docker images from [Docker Hub][dockerhub-tags].

```bash
# latest GitLab Community Edition (CE)
docker pull feskol/gitlab:latest
docker pull feskol/gitlab:ce     # "ce" is same as "latest"

# latest GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE)
docker pull feskol/gitlab:ee

# Specific version - replace "-ce" to "-ee" for Enterprise Edition
docker pull feskol/gitlab:17-ce
docker pull feskol/gitlab:17.6-ce
docker pull feskol/gitlab:17.6.2-ce
docker pull feskol/gitlab:17.6.2-ce.0
```

These images are used like GitLab‚Äôs official Docker images.  
Refer to **GitLab's Docker** documentation for setup instructions:

- https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/docker/installation.html

Here‚Äôs an example setup using `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
    gitlab:
        image: feskol/gitlab:17.6.2-ce # change the tag to your needs
        container_name: gitlab
        restart: unless-stopped
        hostname: 'gitlab.example.com'
        environment:
            GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG: |
                # Add any other gitlab.rb configuration here, each on its own line
                # Reduce the number of running workers in order to reduce memory usage
                puma['worker_processes'] = 2
                sidekiq['concurrency'] = 9
        ports:
            - '80:80'
            - '443:443'
            - '22:22'
        volumes:
            - './config:/etc/gitlab'
            - './logs:/var/log/gitlab'
            - './data:/var/opt/gitlab'
        shm_size: '256m'
```

## üê≥ Multi-Architecture Support

This repository supports multi-architecture Docker images in addition to ARM64 images. This enhancement ensures
that the Docker images can run seamlessly on both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures.

### Supported Architectures

- **ARM64**: Optimized for ARM64 systems.
- **x86_64**: Uses the official GitLab Docker image.

### Benefits

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Use the same image across multiple platforms.
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Unified image tagging for multi-arch builds simplifies deployment.

### How It Works

The build process creates a docker manifest for multi-arch images. For x86_64, the process leverages the official
GitLab Docker image to ensure compatibility and reliability.

### Usage

To pull the appropriate image for your architecture, simply use:

```bash
docker pull feskol/gitlab:latest    # you can use here any tag from the DockerHub (e.g. 17.6.2-ce / 17.6-ce / ce )
```

Docker will automatically fetch the image matching your system architecture.

## üè∑Ô∏è Tags

The following tags are available for the Docker images, providing flexibility and alignment with GitLab's versioning
system:

- **`latest`**:  
  Points to the newest Community Edition (CE) release available.

- **`ce`**:  
  Represents the newest Community Edition (CE) release available.

- **`ee`**:  
  Represents the newest Enterprise Edition (EE) release available.

- **Version-specific tags**:  
  Tags are generated based on GitLab's versioning system: **`(major).(minor).(patch)-(edition).0`**.  
  For example, if the newest version is `17.6.1-ce.0`,
  the following Docker image tags are created pointing to that version:
    - `17.6.1-ce.0` (original GitLab version)
    - `17.6.1-ce` (version without the `.0` suffix)
    - `17.6-ce` (major and minor version)
    - `17-ce` (major version only)

Find [all available tags on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/feskol/gitlab/tags).

> [!NOTE]
> This project supports **GitLab (CE/EE)** starting from version **17 and higher**!

## üîÑ Update

#### Using Docker Compose

1. Stop the container:

```bash
docker compose down
```

2. Update the `docker-compose.yaml` file to the new version tag.

```yaml
# Old image tag:
services:
    gitlab:
        image: feskol/gitlab:17.5.4-ce # outdated version
...

# New image tag
services:
    gitlab:
        image: feskol/gitlab:17.6.2-ce # updated version
...
```

3. Restart the container:

````bash
docker compose up -d
````

> [!WARNING]  
> Always follow the [official update guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/).  
> Use GitLab's [Upgrade Path Tool](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/toolbox/upgrade-path/?distro=docker) for
> step-by-step guidance on update paths.

## üß™ Testing

Tests can be found in the `./tests/unit`.  
To ensure everyone uses the same test suite, I provided a Dockerfile with a docker-compose.yaml file that runs the
tests.

We're using [bashunit](https://bashunit.typeddevs.com/) for testing our scripts. Its binary is located in the `./lib`
directory.  
To ensure dependencies remain up-to-date, a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/bashunit-update.yml`) has been set up to
check for new releases on a weekly basis. If a new release is found, a pull request (PR) is automatically created. Since
there are existing GitHub Actions that run tests using `bashunit`, it tries to automatically merge the PR if no errors
occur.

#### Command:

To run the tests, run:

```bash
# Run all tests
docker compose run --rm test

# Run tests for specific folder
docker compose run --rm test ../lib/bashunit ./unit/workflows/build
```

If you encounter errors, try using the `--verbose` option for more details.

```bash
docker compose run --rm test ../lib/bashunit --verbose ./unit
```

#### Structure:

```
...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib                 # bashunit binary
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts             # scripts for the build/syncversion workflows
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fixtures        # fixtures for the tests
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helper          # helping scripts (e.g. "test-case.sh"-files)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unit            # The actual tests
```
